# Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation-
With this dataset, we try to segment customers and provide insights with the analysis results of the business team. 
The goal in this project is to create personalized services for different customer segments. 
This will be effective in keeping customers loyal to our service products and impacting service costs.


## Steps 
1.   Exploratory Data Analysis (Descriptive, Univariate, Multivariate)
2.   Feature Enginering for preapare the data before modeling
3.   Modeling with K-Means Clustering 
4.   Evaluation with Elbow method and shilhouette
5.   Business Recomendation 

## Conclusion Results
Two customer segmentation clusters were formed as follows.
1. Cluster 0 (First) is a customer with a large total_km, small recency, large frequency, large monetary and large avg_discount.
2. Cluster 1 (second) are customers with small total_km, large recency, small frequency, small monetary and large avg_discount.

So, it can be concluded that customers with large monetary behavior are total_km, large frequency and small recency. 
Therefore, to increase revenue -- or monetary from customers, companies can reach customers with these criteria.

## Recomendation of Business 
* Maintaining high class customers by providing first class facilities and airport lounges in order to increase customer satisfaction. 
In addition, it also applies the concept of Membership, where in this case customers are assumed to be those who use services for long distances 
with high frequency so they consider convenience in their mobility. The membership concept offers a choice of subscription fees with careful 
calculations for services other than flight ticket costs. This includes snack services, meals, and comfortable seats and facilities.

* Providing attractive promos to middle class and low class customers in order to increase airplane ticket purchase transactions and provide 
redemption points aimed at exchanging free airplane tickets. In addition, it also offers the LCC (Lost Cost Carrier) Concept, in which in this 
case customers are assumed to be those who use services for short distances, so they don't really need extra services (convenience). Can separate 
ticket prices from service prices such as snacks, meals, or choice of seat comfort. This concept can reach a wider lower market segment. It also doesn't limit 
if there are customers in the low and medium class segments, they can still enjoy better service than just the price of flight tickets.
